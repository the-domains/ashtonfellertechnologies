What happens when Google and NASA work together?  This.

What can you do with the quantum chip pictured above?  We're still learning to code for the quantum bits inside.  These QuBits are said to hold zeroes and ones simultaneously (as opposed to one or the other in traditional chips) however the truth is a little different.  A QuBit is a two dimensional plane of possibilities instead of a binary zero dimensional set of two options.  This means a QuBit can hold an infinite range of possibilities of Real Numbers within a range of (1,1) and (0,0) so a single QuBit can hold infinite data theoretically.  Realistically, there must be a way to differentiate different data points so the set of possibilities is limited but it will still be much much greater (exponentially) than a traditional bit.  The reason it has taken this long to get to a quantum chip is explained partially by the picture below.

This is basically a giant freezer that houses the single quantum chip which is suspended in the center of the container.  D-Wave is the third party to making quantum computing work as their containers keep temperatures incredibly close to absolute zero (0 degress Kelvin) which is necessary for quantum chips to work.  The minimal temperature reduces and stops the vibrations of atoms and molecules surrounding the quantum chip so that nothing bumps into it while it is doing its thing.  Previously, quantum chips would lose all data allocation (the RAM would get scrambled basically) due to molecules bumping into the QuBit molecule processor.  By removing this noise, we can actually use the quantum chip processing to get data back that makes sense and is arranged in a way we can interact with.  

I'm really excited about what this leap in computing can achieve and what it will mean for all our lives in the coming decades.
