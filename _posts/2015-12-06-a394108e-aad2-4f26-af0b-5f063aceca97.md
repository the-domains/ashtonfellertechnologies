The Grid: Windows Phone

I am, I'll admit, a Microsoft exclusive user. My computer, tablet, and phone are all Microsoft products and I also wear the Microsoft Band. I embrace the Microsoft ecosystem with a cold shoulder however due to the neglect from third party developers and lack of apps upon release of new products, such as TheGrid.io (which builds this website by the way). I love it but I hardly recommend it to others. 

Thegrid, unsurprisingly, did not launch beta with a Windows phone or Windows 10 app. The upside is that the edge browser runs the website and editor well. Despite a few overlapping nav menus everything is doable and accessible. (I'm writing this on my phone now, one the new Lumia 950 types.) 

I hope for a Windows app in the future, but for now I am at least not road blocked from posting on the go.

Edit: After posting as pure text I attempted to add photos but there is no option to do so on a phone using the website. As this is beta, I'll notify the grid and update this post of any resolution.
