[Snap Chat Outages][0]

Unsurprisingly, the largest are in Los Angeles, New York, London, and the northwestern part of the European continent where user density is higher.  (This doesn't effect me because, as mentioned, I am a Windows Phone user which doesn't have a SnapChat app.)  =(  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/06d93588-40e7-433b-8365-171bb2c2700e.PNG)

[Cnet][1] just released an article noting the outages of snap chat and the issues surrounding start up companies and/or fast growing tech companies and their growing pains.  I don't disagree with the general principle, but this outage is not a simple growing pain that suddenly occurred for SnapChat.

More likely, this was something that could have been avoided and with the funding behind this fast growing company, should have.  That being said, it doesn't stop work, impede everyday life, or hamper business.  All in all, not a big deal, but enough to grab a headline.
