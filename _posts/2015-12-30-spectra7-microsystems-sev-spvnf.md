Spectra7 Microsystems is a neat little tech company up in Canada (with offices in California and Ireland) that is making really cool electronic components.  Specifically, it has created the ability to miniaturize wired transmissions of multiple types by laying them over one another while on the wire and then sorting them back out once they are received at their destination.  

I understand much of how this works and what they do as I was researching similar wave domain function reconstruction while studying mathematics at Arizona State University.  Using calculus and linear algebra, one is able to create a matrix of probable or expected values formed from multiple levels of integration and differentiation.  

Combined with statistics to create a probability curve of expected results, values can be deciphered with extremely high accuracy despite noise levels of 30 to 50% and data loss up to 70%.  This reconstruction is what makes the interconnecting wires of Spectra7 Microsystems proprietary which is their edge in the mobile, wearable, and AR/VR realities we are beginning to encounter.  

I'm invested in this company and see them doing well in the future based on their patents and technological advances and industry placement.
