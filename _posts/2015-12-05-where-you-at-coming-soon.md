It's been an interesting journey in the creation of the Where You At? platform. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/84b9e491-2b71-4b08-9ea1-9d77a7253499.png)

We've weathered ups and downs of productivity, enthusiasm, and progress in the past nine months and we are excited once again.  We are so so close to releasing the iOS app that integrates with the Where You At? platform which will be a large milestone for us.  Previously, we created a beta application on Android, a web portal with a different set of features, and some marketing processes and videos of the basic concepts.  The app for iPhone will combine all the features we have so far into a neat little package so it will be the culmination of each project's contributions.  

We have come a long way in such a short time and have so much more ahead of us as well.  This ending feels much more like a beginning to me.
